## - [Learning to Learn how to Answer Questions for Question/Answer Tasks: An In-depth Analysis and Implementations for Recent Deep Q/A Architectures (WIP)]

Make  a TLDR

disclaimer: This paper is not about an architecture that learns to learns such as (LINK TO GRADIENT LEARNING PAPER), but in this case it is the reader who will potentially be learning to learn :) I just really like these titles as do many others. LINK TO TWITTER LEARNING TO LEARN BY LEARNING TO LEARN GRAdient descent by gradient descent.

Introduction to Deep Q/A architecture, mainly focused on the recent developments by Salesforce team (DMN/DMN+ from Metamind) and University of Washington/ Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (BiDAF). 

Mention that you will do a deep dive analysis for the DMN+ model just to show what the pipeline looks like and will release deep dives with implementation for DCN and BiDAF as well.

What dose Q/A look like (babI examples, SQuAD examples, etc.)? What can we do, what can't we do? Link to Socher's talk.

Analysis/Implementations:
DMN+ 
	   Briefly mention DMN and link to tutorial)
	   Provide short summary of DMN+ and link to tutorial
	   Show architecture from paper with citations
	   Show some preprocessing images.
	   Provide shapes breakdown with plots (don't forget episode plot from DMN paper)
	   Talk about why you used gradient noise (Neelakantan paper) and provide citation
	   Provide code for certain parts of the shapes breakdown (for better understanding for readers)   
DCN
	Summarize main idea
	Provide architecture diagrams with citations
	Talk about cool aspects of architecture but also down falls
BiDAF
	Summarize main idea, mention it is currently 2nd
	Provide architecture diagrams with citations
	Talk about cool aspects of architecture but also down falls
	
Model Interpretation:
	Show what the model sees and some of the Q/A images (for DMN+ and DCN).

SQuAD leaderboard (talk about very competitive and collaborative community). SOTA lasting for more than 2 weeks is starting to become rare.

What is left to do? What are the next steps? Talk about joint networks and similar work being done with knowledge bases and logical reasoning, etc. Point to work by Salesforce and Pete SCOMAROCKS STARTUP  AND also mention MSFT (currently leading on SQUAD) but talk about "we are more than likely to see that fluctuate very soon). 

GitHub Repo: Implementations will be uploaded soon (BiDAF is still WIP). Follow on
